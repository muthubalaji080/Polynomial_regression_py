# Polynomial_regression_py
This project demonstrates how to use polynomial regression in Python to predict salaries based on years of experience. Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (years of experience) and the dependent variable (salary) is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.
