# Polynomial Regression for Salary Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use polynomial regression in Python to predict salaries based on years of experience. Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (years of experience) and the dependent variable (salary) is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains two columns: 'YearsExperience' and 'Salary'. It consists of a list of employees with their corresponding years of experience and salaries.

You can find the dataset present in the name of position_salaries.csv
